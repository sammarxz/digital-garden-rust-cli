# Digital Garden

A CLI tool for the creations and maintenance of Digital Gardens.

## Commands

### write

Open a new file to write in our digital garden. Since we don't necessarily
know what we want to title what we're writing, we'll leave the titla as optional
and ask the user for it later if they don't provide it up-front.

```shell
garden write
garden write -t "Some Title"
```
